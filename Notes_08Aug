OnChanges fired first
doCheck will be fired if any change happens in any component in UI - This can be a performamce issue

YOu can check for global Listerners in the source
Use ngOnDestroy to unsubscribe to events

In Directives you can use ViewContainerRef to access the parent of the element.... Similar to the way we access ElementRef in the directive
Use LocalSessionStorage or make use of service to store 

ng build
ng build --prod
Angular uses by default the Just In Time Compiler to compile. Drawback - When any changes made, it sends a request to server to compile
Here it is compiled and rendered

Another compilation model - AOT(Ahead of Time) compilation.
This way the code is compiled ahead of time and then its only rendered.
